 ### Perceived benefits of the topic-based communication compared to request-response (HTTP)
 
 Topic-based communication is versatile
 -One publisher can publish data to many subscribers 
 -One subscriber can get data from multiple publishers
 
 Loose coupling between publishers and subscribers 
 -Publishers don't have to be coupled with subscribers, they can be built separately and they don't have to know each others moves
 
 High scalability compared to basic request-response.

 ### Main learnings
 
 I had never heard about topic-based communication before so I could say that it was the main learning from this exercise. I learnt how the basics of message brokers work and practiced how they work in practice with RabbitMQ. This exercise also gave me deeper level of understanding how things work in docker (Mainly the file-pattern).
